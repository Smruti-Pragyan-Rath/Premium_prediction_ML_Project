# Annual Premium Price Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

# Project Overview

This project is a Machine Learning model to predict the annual premium price of an insurance policy based on customer-related features such as age, number of dependents, income level, and lifestyle attributes.

The goal is to help **insurance companies** and analysts make data-driven pricing decisions and provide personalised offers to customers.

# Features

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualisations

2. Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling

3. **Model training** with **Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, XGBoost** (and comparison of results)

4. Performance evaluation with metrics such as RMSE, MAE, RÂ²

5. Deployed an interactive Streamlit web app to input features and get premium predictions

# Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)

Streamlit (deployment & UI)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (EDA and visualization)

GitHub (Version control)

# Dataset

Contains customer information and insurance details

Key features: age, gender, region, dependents, income_level, smoking_status, genetic risk, etc.

Target variable: annual_premium_price

# How It Works

Data Preprocessing â†’ Clean & transform raw data

Model Training â†’ Train ML algorithms and tune hyperparameters

Evaluation â†’ Compare models and choose best performer

Deployment â†’ Serve predictions via Streamlit app

ðŸ“ˆ Results

Best performing model: XGBoost (RÂ² = 3.67)

**Linear Regression provided a strong baseline**

Streamlit app allows users to **test predictions with custom inputs**
